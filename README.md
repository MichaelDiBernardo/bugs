# Nora Looks For Bugs

## TL;DR

I made a game about finding insects for my toddler niece. It's [here](https://bugs.mikedebo.com).

## The Story

My 2.5-year-old niece likes insects. Last week, I saw her zooming into photos of bugs on her mom's phone, and I had an idea for her first "videogame."

I thought she might enjoy a simple game where she could look under rocks for bugs. But, to keep it surprising, sometimes there should be non-bugs under the rocks. I wanted it to have a geocities-era blursed vibe to it.

My partner decided that the surprises should be emojis of our nieceâ€™s favorite things.

I chose to make it a progressive web app, because that way my niece could recognize the app on her mom's phone by the bug icon (she can't read yet.)

You can find the game at [https://bugs.mikedebo.com](https://bugs.mikedebo.com). Make sure to ask your parents if it's OK first.

I'd love to share videos of my niece playing it for the first time, but for obvious reasons I won't be doing that. There was a lot of excited shrieking involved, which made me very happy.

## Instructions

- Scroll around the forest floor and click on rocks to find surprises
- The surprises sometimes peek out from under the rocks for maximum suspense!
- You can hurl the rocks by touching/clicking them to reveal the surprise beneath
- Uncle Mike will announce the insects; Auntie I announces the other surprises. (Auntie I doesn't like bugs.)
- Clicking the surprise will make more funny sounds.

Enjoy!

## Things that surprised me

- Nora is much better at scrolling than I expected! I originally made the map quite small assuming she'd have a hard time navigating, but I was wrong.
- I thought she'd like the surprises, but she seeming dgaf about them. It's all about the bugs.
- Older kids also appear to appreciate the game. I thought it would be too dumb for them.
- It's liberating to make things for pre-literate kids. Eliminating text reduces options by a lot!
- I realized that I've made several games tailored to specific individuals. I guess it's becoming somewhat of a thing. I don't consider myself a "game-maker", but I find making games for specific people is quite satisfying. I can go from idea to "gift-sized" game very quickly.

## Known issues

I wanted the map to start focused on the center of the scrollable area, but the combination of myself and claude-3.5-sonnet could not figure it out. If you do, please let me know. I'm sure it's simple, but learning more about CSS was an anti-goal of this project for me.
