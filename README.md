# Nora Looks For Bugs

A game in which a 2.5 year old will hopefully look for bugs under rocks before she gets bored.

## Assets

- Forest floor texture from [here](https://www.texturemax.com/forest-floor-terrain-0006/)
- PWA template from [here](https://github.com/nikkifurls/simplepwa)

## Todo

- Fix all the PWA assets, some are still default
- Make sounds when rocks are flung
- Make rocks smaller so that they're easier to find?
- Add things under rocks
- Add ridiculous sounds
